= Spark Java Wordcount

== Introduction

The current project is a simple proof of concept on how to work with http://spark.apache.org/[Apache Spark]
for calculating the number of words within a document.
The initial sample code was taken from the examples provided with the Spark installation
and afterwards adapted to only return the most frequent words in the document.

== Setup of the environment

The reason why I am writing this document is because I've stumbled on several issues while
performing the setup of the test environment.

I opted to use a http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html[Spark Standalone Cluster]
based on Docker and the files to be used as input for the word counters are retrieved via HDFs.


include::setup-docker-cluster.adoc[]
include::setup-hdfs.adoc[]


== Running the example

With everything setup, we can proceed to execute the word count example
