=== Setup of HDFS

I opted for the purpose of this proof of concept to setup a https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.3/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html#Pseudo-Distributed_Operation[Pseudo-Distributed HDFS Cluster]

In this case I opted for performing the installation of HDFS on my own machine.

The only thing to point here is that I used the IP of my machine (in order to be able
to access it via IP from the Docker machines):

----
➜  hadoop-2.7.3 cat etc/hadoop/core-site.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="configuration.xsl"?>

<!-- Put site-specific property overrides in this file. -->

<configuration>
    <property>
        <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
        <value>hdfs://10.0.0.2:9000</value>
    </property>
</configuration>
----

(I guess this operation may be very very likely done also via Docker)

I have manually copied a few files on the HDFS cluster:

----
➜  hadoop-2.7.3 bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/marius/gutenberg
➜  hadoop-2.7.3 bin/hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal ~/Downloads/leonardo-da-vinci-notebooks.txt /user/marius/gutenberg
➜  hadoop-2.7.3 bin/hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal ~/Downloads/james-joyce-ulysses.txt /user/marius/gutenberg
➜  hadoop-2.7.3 bin/hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal ~/Downloads/stopwords.txt /user/marius/gutenberg
